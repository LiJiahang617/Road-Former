## Usage 

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LiJiahang617/Road-Former.git
cd Road-Former
```
Please refer to [MMSegmentation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation/blob/main/docs/en/get_started.md#installation) for the dependency instructions.
You will need a compiled ``.so`` file, or you can download the pre-compiled file from here:
- [_ext.cpython-38-x86_64-linux-gnu.so](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1yg52J4umKiPLVVDeFwLfBA?pwd=apei)

This file is complied using the NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU, which may cause error when under other devices.
### Running

```bash
python tools/train.py --config <config-file-path>
python tools/test.py --config <config-file-path> --pretrained <pre-trained-pth-path>
```
